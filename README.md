Research Project Template
=========================

### Overview
This repository sets out the skeleton of an organizational structure used for scientific research. It loosely follows what I have used for several of my research projects and I hope it inspires you to conduct your research in an open, reproducible, and honest manner.

### How to Use
To use this template for your research, fork this repository, change the name
to something descriptive for your project, and adjust the licensing as you
see fit.
